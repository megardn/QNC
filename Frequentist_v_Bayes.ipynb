    "# Frequentist vs Bayesian Approaches\n",
    "QNC Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objective is to gain insights into thinking about inference from a \"Frequentist\" versus a \"Bayesian\" perspective. In brief, because a Frequentist does not consider the probability of an event or state of the world or hypothesis, only their frequency of occurrance, it is not possible to ask questions of the form \"what is the probabilty that hypothesis x is true?\" Instead, one can only consider questions of the form, \"what is the probabilty that I would have obtained my data, given that hypothesis x is true?\" In contrast, Bayesians consider the probabilities of such things (often called the strength of belief), but doing so can require making assumptions that can be difficult to prove.\n",

    "Let's start with a simple example, taken from:\n",
    "__[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_HIV)__\n",

    "\"Imagine running an HIV test on A SAMPLE of 1000 persons ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05)...\" i.e., the probability that someone who takes the test gets a POSITIVE result despite the fact that the person does NOT have HIV\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...and no false negative rate.\" i.e., The probability that someone who takes the test gets a NEGATIVE result despite the fact that the person DOES have HIV."
